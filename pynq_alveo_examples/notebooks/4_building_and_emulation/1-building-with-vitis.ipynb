    "# Introduction to Building Bitstream with Vitis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how to use the Vitis command line to build xclbin files. PYNQ works with any xclbin file so the steps here are not PYNQ-specific. The aim is to produce an xclbin file that contains a single vector addition kernel that can be used with the introductory notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following prerequisites should be installed: Vitis; and a Alveo development platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing the Kernel in C\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first example we are going to create a simple accelerator to add together two arrays of numbers. First we define the prototype of the function which will take three array pointers (two for the inputs and one for the output) and the number of elements to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "    void vadd(int* in_a, int* in_b, int* out_c, int count) {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to tell the compiler how the arguments should be interpreted. There are two main types of argument in Vivado HLS that we need to consider: AXI-lite slave connections which are generally used for registers that provide configuration and AXI master connections which the accelerator uses to access large blocks of data. For `vadd` the three array arguments map well to AXI master ports as the acccelerator will be reading and writing data from memory as well as an AXI-lite port to set the address of the buffer. The `count` argument just needs an AXI-lite register. These types are specified using pragmas in the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=in_a offset=slave\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilte port=in_a bundle=control\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=in_b offset=slave\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilte port=in_b bundle=control\n",

    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilte port=out_c bundle=control\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=count bundle=control\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to specify how the accelerator should be controlled. For a Vitis accelerator this should usually be via the same AXI-lite interface as other arguments. This is specified using a pragma tied to the `return` port\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reste of the function is a simple loop that performs the addition\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "        for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {\n",
    "            *out_c++ = *in_a++ + *in_b++;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
