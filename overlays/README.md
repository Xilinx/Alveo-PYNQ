# Overlays for Alveo-PYNQ

In order to run the provided introductory notebooks we have designed a few 
overlays, and we have included the source files to rebuild them in this folder.
In particular, the overlays are obtained by combining a few ad-hoc kernels, 
along with a selected number of examples from the 
[Vitis Accel Examples](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/63bae10d581df40cf9402ed71ea825476751305d) 
repository.

## Included Overlays

There are a total of three overlays included in this repository:

1. **Introduction**: this overlay includes the *vector addition kernel* from 
the Vitis Accel Examples' 
[hello world](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/63bae10d581df40cf9402ed71ea825476751305d/hello_world) 
application, and the *vector multiplication kernel* from the 
[SLR Assign](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/63bae10d581df40cf9402ed71ea825476751305d/sys_opt/slr_assign) 
application. It is used for the 
[introduction notebooks](../pynqexamples/notebooks/1-introduction).

2. **Kernel Optimizations**: this overlay contains the *vector addition* and 
*vector multiplication* kernels (using streams) from the Vitis Accel Examples' 
[Stream Kernel to Kernel Memory Mapped](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/63bae10d581df40cf9402ed71ea825476751305d/host/streaming_k2k_mm) 
application, as well as a *wide vector addition* kernel that uses a 
a 512 bit datapath and has been specifically developed for this overlay, and 
whose source code is available [here](./src/kernel_opt.cpp). This last kernel 
is duplicated in the design, with one version using only a single memory bank, 
and the second version using a different memory bank for each buffer. It is used 
for the [kernel optimization notebooks](../pynqexamples/notebooks/2-kernel-optimization).

3. **Advanced Features**: this overlay includes a *vector addition* and *matrix
multiplication* kernels specifically developed for this overlay, for which the 
source code is available [here](./src/advanced_features.cpp). It is used for 
the [advanced features notebooks](../pynqexamples/notebooks/3-advanced-features).

## Supported Boards/Shells

Currently, we distribute overlays only for the following Alveo boards and shells:

Shell                    | Board             
-------------------------|-----------------
xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2|Xilinx Alveo U200
xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2|Xilinx Alveo U250
xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_1|Xilinx Alveo U280
xilinx_u50_xdma_201920_1|Xilinx Alveo U50
xilinx_aws-vu9p-f1_dynamic_5_0|Amazon AWS F1

Designs are built using Vitis 2019.2.
The *Kernel Optimization* overlay is not available for the Alveo U280 and U50.

## Rebuilding Overlays

Make sure you have cloned the Alveo-PYNQ repo using the `--recursive` option, 
so that the included git submodules are also pulled at checkout.
In case you haven't, you can check them out at a later stage by typing:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

To build xclbins for a new shell, move to the `overlays` folder and run the 
`make build` command, passing the appropriate `DEVICE`:
   ```bash
   cd overlays
   make build DEVICE=<target-shell>
   ```

You can then do `make install` to copy the overlays in the appropriate 
notebooks folder. 
If you want to do everything in one go (`build` and `install`):
   ```bash
   make DEVICE=<target-shell>
   ```

To install built xclbins in a specific path (different from the default one):
   ```bash
   make install INSTALL_PATH=<target-path>
   ```

It is expected that the target path contains the appropriate notebooks folders.
Otherwise, the install step will not be carried out.

## Use Built Overlays

Once you have synthesized your overlays, you can use them by first getting the
notebooks avoiding overlay lookup (Refer to `pynq get-notebooks --help` for 
info on the used options.) 

```bash
pynq get-notebooks --from-package pynq_alveo_examples --ignore-overlays \
   --path <target-path>
```

And then copy the overlays in the target directory, using the `make install` 
command

```bash
make install INSTALL_PATH=<target-path>/pynq-notebooks
```
